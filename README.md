# hamoye_internship

## Introduction
[Hamoye Ltd.](https://hamoye.com/) is an ed-tech startup and it's obsession is to help solve the paradox of providing high quality education at massive scale, particularly across Africa.
Hamoyeâ€™s mission is to develop an army of problem solvers across Africa using an innovative approach to education. Hamoye (Yoruba word meaning "the wise one") - is an innovative learning platform and a job market.

## Projects
This repository contains all sprint projects from each level of the hamoye Data Science internship.

1. [Introduction to Python for Machine Learning](https://github.com/doyinsolamiolaoye/hamoye_internship/blob/master/Hamoye_stage_one_quiz.ipynb)
    * This project explores how  machine learning techniques can be an invaluable tool for solving one of the grand challenges posed to humanity - [climate change](https://hamoye.com/app/course-details/11993f74d1c1f000). I worked on cleaning, wrangling, exploring, providing summary statistics and interesting visualisations on a public utility data containing millions of rows and tens of files in structured format.
    
2. [Machine Learning: Regression - Predicting Energy Efficiency of Buildings](https://github.com/doyinsolamiolaoye/hamoye_internship/blob/master/hamoye_stage_two_quiz.ipynb)
   * I developed a multivariate multiple regression model and also used various regression model to find out which model represents and fits our data the best to help improve the accuracy of the predictions.

3. [ Machine Learning: Classification - Managing the Quality Metric of Global Ecological Footprint]()
   * I classified and predicted the quality metrics (qascore) of the ecological footprint data for the different countries. The data used includes total and per capita national biocapacity, the ecological footprint of consumption, the ecological footprint of production and total area in hectares.
